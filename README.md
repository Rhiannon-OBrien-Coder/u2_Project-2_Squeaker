# u2_Project-2_Squeaker

## Where to begin
The plan for this project is to make a twitter knock off style application themed around mice instead of birds. When you post on Squeaker, it's called a "squeak"! When you follow another user, it's called "Joining their mischief". "Giving a post a like" is "Giving a squeak a cheese".

Auto logged in is fine - dont look into jot and authorization stuff ~Jeremy.

## MVP

☐ Have full CRUD on all models across the Back End

## Stretch Goals

☐ AAU I want to be able to "follow" other users, and see what users are "following" me.
