# u2_Project-2_Squeaker

## Where to begin
The plan for this project is to make a twitter knock off style application themed around mice instead of birds. When you post on Squeaker, it's called a "squeak"! When you follow another user, it's called "Joining their mischief".

## ERD

## Wireframe

## User Stories
☐ AAU I want to be able to make an account

☐ AAU I want to be able to look at all the posts I've made

☐ AAU I want to be able to make a post to my blog

☐ AAU I want to be able to delete a post on my blog

☐ AAU I want to be able to update a post in case I made a typo

## MVP
☐ ** Have at least 3 related data entities **

☐ Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and polished user interface.

☐ Have full CRUD on all models across the Back End

## Stretch Goals
☐ AAU I want to be able to comment on other users' posts

☐ AAU I want to be able to "follow" other users, and see what users are "following" me.

☐ AAU I want to be able to see the posts of the users I follow
